# Daily-42NiceLogtimeRankings2022

## Introduction
This little project was born out of a discussion with friends about the previous year and a desire to improve my skills in writing scripts using JS and working with REST APIs. It may also be a helpful resource for those interested in using the 42 API in their own projects. For those who are curious about the results of this project, be sure to check out the result.txt file ðŸ˜‰
